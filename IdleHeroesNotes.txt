Changes Needed:
-----------------
* Character stories have misspellings, etc. 
* it's weird to get money from each hit in manual attack
* Add a popup with credits - Pillbiddit made 3 monsters, etc
* Maybe when you unlock a new character they join your team and they have some sort of base power
  Should they wait until you have them join? (only show story button, their base power, and a button to have them join?)
* Add more monsters
* Add more upgrades
* improve balance of power, cost, progression


Advanced Improvements
-----------------------
* Upgrades for team wide boosts (better gear, magic item, add a healer, or whatever)
* If you ever start creating a lot of monsters, it would be cool to add regions that you can enter once you have enough
  power, and there are bonuses to fighting there, plus new/different creatures (but allow moving back and forth between them)
